# Movie-Recommendation-System-using-R
The Movie Recommendation System using R makes tailored movie suggestions via collaborative filtering. It profiles users based on ratings and movie genres. User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF) creates suggestions by evaluating user similarity based on preferences. Users may search for movies by category and evaluate suggestions using metrics. 

The code begins by reading the necessary data from CSV files, such as movie information, ratings, and genre information. The system then conducts data preprocessing to extract movie genres and generate a genre matrix indicating the presence or absence of each genre for each film. Next, user profiles are generated by mapping movie ratings to a binary representation of user preferences for each film genre. Unrated films are excluded from the dataset in order to concentrate on rated films.

The code determines user profiles by multiplying the genre matrix by the binary ratings matrix. This phase establishes the intensity of association between users and film genres, indicating their predilection for particular genres.The use of user-based collaborative filtering (UBCF) to generate movie recommendations. The code calculates the similarity between users based on their preferences by applying the cosine similarity measure. Using the normalized rating matrix, the recommender model is constructed, and recommendations are generated for a specific user.

Cross-validation is utilized by the evaluation scheme to determine the precision of the recommendations. There are obtained evaluation results indicating the efficacy of the recommendation system at various recommendation list lengths. Outputs of the system include a search matrix that facilitates searching for movies based on genre, the titles of action movies produced in a specific year, and a list of recommended movies for a specific user.

In conclusion, the Movie Recommendation System utilizing R demonstrates the use of collaborative filtering techniques to generate personalized movie recommendations. By analyzing user preferences and movie genres, the system assists users in discovering movies that match their interests and preferences.
